## Notes

  

- Navbar is built automatically pointing to every section in the html.
- While scrolling, when the top of a section reach the upper 50% of the viewport, the section and the element of the menu related to it, becomes active.
- If you click on a menu element, you will scroll smoothly to that section. Menu element and section will become active like if you scroll manually.
- After 3 seconds without scrolling, the nabvar hides until you scroll again. The hidding function triggers after the first time you scroll in the web.
